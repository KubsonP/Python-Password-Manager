# Python-Password-Manager
My first python project
This project is meant to create, store and encrypt your passwords. I used fernet instead of hashing for the sole purpose of ability to decrypt the password if needed. Option 
which hashing doesn`t have. Hashing is of course safer thanks to that, but I wanted to have the ability to check the passwords.

Before running the program you need to create folder for storing your passwords and another folder for your key!
